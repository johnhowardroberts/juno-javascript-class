  <p>Don't forget to open your console to see the output!</p>
  <script>
    console.log('What is your favourite food?');

    // EXERCISE 1:
    // Create a variable to hold a favourite food and console.log this variable value.

    const favFood = 'Banana';

    // console.log this sentence into the console:
    // "My favourite food is -----." using the answer from the set variable

    console.log(`My favourite food is ${favFood}`);


    // EXERCISE 2:
    // Create a variable with the starting value of 0. We will use it to count cookies!

    let counter = 0;
    
    // Add 1 to the current value of that variable,

    counter ++;

    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."

    console.log(`I baked a cookie. Now I have ${counter} cookies.`);

    // Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable,

    counter --;

    // then (once again) re-assign the new value to the same variable.

    counter = counter;

    // Log this sentence into the console:
    // "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."

    console.log(`I just ate a cookie. Now I have ${counter} cookies left`);


    // EXERCISE 3
    // BONUS: HINT: Google how to generate a random number in JS
    // we were given a random box of cookies!
    // Create a variable that holds a random number between 1 and 100.

    const randNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

    // add that new number to the cookie count and log this sentence into the console "I was given a random amount of cookies, I now have -- cookies!"

    let finalCookies = counter + randNum;

    console.log(`I was given a random amount of cookies. Now I have ${finalCookies}`);
